All .ptrac files in this folder will be imported during script execution. Any .ptrac can be added and will import.

.ptrac files will be imported into clients. If a client doesn't exist that matches the client in the .ptrac, it will be imported with the option to Keep Original Client Details checked which creates a new client for the report to be imported to.
