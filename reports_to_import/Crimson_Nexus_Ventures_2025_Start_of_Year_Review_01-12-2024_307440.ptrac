cross-site scripting vulnerabilities arise when data is copied from a request and echoed into the application's immediate response in an unsafe way. An attacker can use the vulnerability to construct a request that, if issued by another application user, will cause JavaScript code supplied by the attacker to execute within the user's browser in the context of that user's session with the application.</p><p>The attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing the victim's session token or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf, and logging their keystrokes.</p><p>Users can be induced to issue the attacker's crafted request in various ways. For example, the attacker can send a victim a link containing a malicious URL in an email or instant message. They can submit the link to popular web sites that allow content authoring, for example in blog comments. And they can create an innocuous looking web site that causes anyone viewing it to make arbitrary cross-domain requests to the vulnerable application (using either the GET or the POST method).</p><p>The security impact of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities is dependent upon the nature of the vulnerable application, the kinds of data and functionality that it contains, and the other applications that belong to the same domain and organization. If the application is used only to display non-sensitive public content, with no authentication or access control functionality, then a cross-site scripting flaw may be considered low risk. However, if the same application resides on a domain that can access cookies for other more security-critical applications, then the vulnerability could be used to attack those other applications, and so may be considered high risk. Similarly, if the organization that owns the application is a likely target for phishing attacks, then the vulnerability could be leveraged to lend credibility to such attacks, by injecting Trojan functionality into the vulnerable application and exploiting users' trust in the organization in order to capture credentials for other applications that it owns. In many kinds of application, such as those providing online banking functionality, cross-site scripting should always be considered high risk. </p>","doc_type":"flaw","doc_version":"2.16.11","exhibits":[],"flaw_id":2373159,"last_update":1746450991701,"reopenedAt":1746450991701,"report_id":840629466,"report_name":"2025 Start of Year Review","sev":1,"severity":"High","severity_key":1,"source":"Burp","status":"In Process","title":"Cross-site scripting (reflected)","visibility":"published","closedAt":null,"fields":{},"jiraIssue":null,"recommendations":"<p>In most situations where user-controllable data is copied into application responses, cross-site scripting \n  attacks can be prevented using two layers of defenses:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Input should be validated as strictly as possible on arrival, given the kind of content that \nit is expected to contain.

This can occur either when the     top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed     certificate, or when intermediate certificates are     missing that would connect the top of the certificate     chain to a known public certificate authority.</li><li>Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate     that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can     occur either when the scan occurs before one of the     certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the     certificate's 'notAfter' dates.</li><li>Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature     that either didn't match the certificate's information     or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be     verified are the result of the certificate's issuer     using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not     support or does not recognize.</li></ul><p>If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

If the secure flag is not set, then the cookie will be transmitted in clear-text if the user visits any HTTP URLs within the cookie's scope. An attacker may be able to induce this event by feeding a user suitable links, either directly or via another web site. Even if the domain that issued the cookie does not host any content that is accessed over HTTP, an attacker may be able to use links of the form http://example.com:443/ to perform the same attack.</p><p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be suitably positioned to eavesdrop on the victim's network traffic. This scenario typically occurs when a client communicates with the server over an insecure connection such as public Wi-Fi, or a corporate or home network that is shared with a compromised computer. Common defenses such as switched networks are not sufficient to prevent this. An attacker situated in the user's ISP or the application's hosting infrastructure could also perform this attack. Note that an advanced adversary could potentially target any connection made over the Internet's core infrastructure.</p>","doc_type":"flaw","doc_version":"2.16.11","exhibits":[],"flaw_id":68624703,"last_update":1746450859697,"reopenedAt":null,"report_id":840629466,"report_name":"2025 Start of Year Review","sev":4,"severity":"Informational","severity_key":4,"source":"Burp","status":"Closed","title":"TLS cookie without secure flag set","visibility":"published","closedAt":1746450859697,"fields":{},"jiraIssue":null,"recommendations":"<p>The secure flag should be set on all cookies that are used for transmitting sensitive data when accessing content over HTTPS.
